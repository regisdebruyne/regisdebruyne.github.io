Im am an evolutionary biologist with an acute interest in the natural history of the elephantids (elephants and mammoths) and the changes in biodiversity through time in general. As a research Engineer at the French Museum of Natural History (MNHN, Paris), I primarily use the tools of comparative genomics and genetics to study those questions. I also have a keen interest in the synergic approaches in evolutionary biology that blend anatomy, paleontology, ecology, ethology and so forth.

This is my personal website, and like I, it is a perpetual work in progress.
